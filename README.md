**Light bulb On or Off"**

**About**

Basic HTML with only one section containing two images of light bulbs. One on and on off. CSS has three classes to create style of how the light bulb is on or off. Javascript is only 16 lines of code with a boolean, and two const. One function to toggle the light on or off by pressing a button.
The button has an eventListener in which I did not put the function inside, but have the toggleLight as a separate function.

**Learning**

This is one of the first projects I did solo while learning from 100Devs. I have done my own learning from YouTube and random articles about JavaScript, but this is the first project I did without someone having to show me. Felt good.
